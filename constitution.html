				<div class="title">History of the Constitution</div>
				<div class="text indent">During the rise of the American Revolution, the Continental Congress wanted to lay out a framework for the future of the country. Fearing a system of government capable of a ruler similar to England, the representatives delegated all of the government power to the legislature. On November 15, 1777, the Articles of Confederation became the first Constitution of the United States. The Articles created a federal government consisting only of a legislature made up of a representative from each of the 13 states. Each of these representatives had the power to strike down any bill proposal, making the states far more powerful than the federal government. This weak government struggled to pass any legislation, and most of all, amending the Articles of Confederation to fix its problems was not possible without support from all 13 states.</div>
				<div class="text indent">Starting on August 31, 1786, a former revolutionary soldier named Daniel Shays led a militia to rebellion in Massachusetts over government taxes. The federal government was incapable of action under the Articles of Confederation, allowing the rebellion to continue for months on end without a federal militia in sight. Shays' Rebellion prompted questioning on the effectiveness of the Articles. Beginning on May 25, 1787, delegates from each state planned to meet in Philadelphia to discuss rectifying issues within the U.S. governing system. Although it had a rocky start, 55 delegates eventually met at the Constitutional Convention after being called upon by James Madison and Alexander Hamilton. There were many who were suspicious of their actions, especially since all deliberations were done in secret, theorizing that the delegates wanted to destroy the state powers in the government. The Constitutional Convention's motives were to create a central government powerful enough to provide for the good of all of America.  Looking at the problems of the Articles of Confederation, the delegates sought to find a way to increase the federal government while also not giving too much power to any one office or group. The concept that followed would be known as separation of powers, and the delegation of those powers in the Constitution would lay the foundation for the future and destiny of the United States.</div>
				<div class="text indent">During the process of ratifying the Constitution, the political leaders of America became divided over the expansion of government power. The result was two parties, the Democratic-Republicans supporting small federal government and the Federalists supporting the Constitution and expanding the federal government. In trying to gain support of the Democratic-Republicans, Federalists adopted a list of amendments to the Constitution known as the Bill of Rights. These Amendments restricted the government from infringing on the safety and rights of the people. To further support for the Constitution, Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, and Jon Jay famously published the Federalist Papers, a collection of 85 writings in support for the Constitution. In the end, the Federalists succeeded in ratifying the Constitution and created a larger federal government capable of protecting and supporting all of its citizens.</div>

				<div class="one">
					<div class="arttitle">Article One</div>
					<div class="sectone">
						<div class="sect gap">Section One</div>
						<div class="text">All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Representatives.</div>
						<div class="sect">Importance</div>
						<div class="text">This section creates the Congress of the United States as the branch of the government that has all legislative power, meaning it can pass laws affecting all people in the United States. The document does not grant any power beyond legislation to Congress, separating the power of lawmaking into its own specific sector rather than placing all power into the hands of one governing body. Within that branch there are two houses, the House of Representatives and the Senate.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="secttwo">
						<div class="sect gap">Section Two</div>
						<div class="text">The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.<br>
						No Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.<br>
						Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the several States which may be included within this Union, according to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed, three fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years, in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand, but each State shall have at Least one Representative; and until such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode-Island and Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six, Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and Georgia three.<br>
						When vacancies happen in the Representation from any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of Election to fill such Vacancies.<br>
						The House of Representatives shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the sole Power of Impeachment.
						</div>
						<div class="sect">Importance</div>
						<div class="text">At the Constitutional Convention, the 12 attending states, Rhode Island having chosen to not send delegates, debated over the issue of representation within Congress. Smaller states backed the New Jersey Plan, which made the number of representatives from each state equal.  Larger states backed the Virginia Plan, which called for representation based on the population of each state. What followed was known as the Great Compromise. The delegates settled on the creation of two houses, the Senate consisting of two representatives per state and the House of Representatives with offices based on the population of the states.<br>Along with the division of house representation, the second section identifies each slave in the U.S. as 3/5 of a person for purposes of taxation and representation. This compromise, known as the Three-Fifth Compromise, came as an agreement between the slaveholders of southern states and the hardly slave-based northern states. The agreement the two sides reached showed that the leaders of America were still not ready to confront the horrors of slavery and avoided confrontation on the subject with a 'kick the can down the road' compromise.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="sectthree">
						<div class="sect gap">Section Three</div>
						<div class="text">The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for six Years; and each Senator shall have one Vote.<br>
						Immediately after they shall be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, they shall be divided as equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of the second Year, of the second Class at the Expiration of the fourth Year, and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year; and if Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature, which shall then fill such Vacancies.<br>
						No Person shall be a Senator who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be chosen.<br>
						The Vice President of the United States shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally divided.<br>
						The Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a President pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United States.<br>
						The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried, the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.<br>
						Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.
						</div>
						<div class="sect">Importance</div>
						<div class="text">Section Three describes the powers of the Senate in lawmaking and the requirements to hold or fill an office. A Senator's term is six years, there are two Senators from each state, and the Senate holds the sole power to act as jurors in the impeachment of other government officials.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="sectfour">
						<div class="sect gap">Section Four</div>
						<div class="text">The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators<br>						The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.</div>
						<div class="sect">Importance</div>
						<div class="text">This section delegates the power of the election process to the state legislation but only under oversight and control of Congress. It also dictates that Congress is obligated to hold a session at least once every year, due to the hardships of traveling at the time.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="sectfive">
						<div class="sect gap">Section Five</div>
						<div class="text">Each House shall be the Judge of the Elections, Returns and Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such Penalties as each House may provide.<br>
						Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a Member.<br>
						Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal.<br>
						Neither House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.</div>
						<div class="sect">Importance</div>
						<div class="text">According to this section, the houses of Congress are responsible for the legitimacy and withstanding of all of their elections and business. It also sets that each house may conduct its business while in session as long as more than half of the people are there. Congress may also set penalties for lack of attendance by their colleagues. Each house of Congress has a responsibility of having transparency and retention of information, having to keep journals on the actions performed by the houses and the voting of each representative. Finally, neither house can be absent during session for an extended time unless the other house allows it.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="sectsix">
						<div class="sect gap">Section Six</div>
						<div class="text">The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for their Services, to be ascertained by Law, and paid out of the Treasury of the United States. They shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place.<br>
						No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time; and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be a Member of either House during his Continuance in Office.</div>
						<div class="sect">Importance</div>
						<div class="text">Members of Congress receive a specific, agreed up salary from the Treasury for their work. A later amendment to the Constitution prohibits Congress from raising their salary for an ongoing session. More importantly, Section Six allows for members of Congress to be free from arrest while in session for non-violent crimes or crimes that don't present a threat to the safety of America or its citizens directly. In attempting to further separate powers, the authors of the Constitution prohibited representatives from also holding a civil or judicial office, keeping the Judicial and Legislative Branches separate.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="sectseven">
						<div class="sect gap">Section Seven</div>
						<div class="text">All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amendments as on other Bills.<br>
						Every Bill which shall have passed the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States; If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his Objections to that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively. If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which Case it shall not be a Law.<br>
						Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be presented to the President of the United States; and before the Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.</div>
						<div class="sect">Importance</div>
						<div class="text">This article outlines the process of a bill becoming law through the legislative branch. It specifies that the House of Representatives has the power to create revenue bills and the Senate may only make adjustments to those bills. The process starts with one of the houses, where it must be passed by a simple majority in order to move to the next house. That house may propose changes and alterations to the bill before voting on it, where a simple majority passes it. If changes are proposed, the House and Senate must agree on a single bill, pass it, and then it can be sent to the President. The President can sign the bill into law, veto it, or not return it at all and have the same effect as signing it into law. If the bill is vetoed, the houses can override the President with a two-thirds vote from each house.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="secteight">
						<div class="sect gap">Section Eight</div>
						<div class="text">The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for the common Defence and general Welfare of the United States; but all Duties, Imposts and Excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;<br>
						To borrow Money on the credit of the United States;<br>
						To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, and among the several States, and with the Indian Tribes;<br>
						To establish an uniform Rule of Naturalization, and uniform Laws on the subject of Bankruptcies throughout the United States;<br>
						To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures;<br>
						To provide for the Punishment of counterfeiting the Securities and current Coin of the United States;<br>
						To establish Post Offices and post Roads;<br>
						To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;<br>
						To constitute Tribunals inferior to the supreme Court;<br>
						To define and punish Piracies and Felonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against the Law of Nations;<br>
						To declare War, grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal, and make Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water;<br>
						To raise and support Armies, but no Appropriation of Money to that Use shall be for a longer Term than two Years;<br>
						To provide and maintain a Navy;<br>
						To make Rules for the Government and Regulation of the land and naval Forces;<br>
						To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions;<br>
						To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the Militia, and for governing such Part of them as may be employed in the Service of the United States, reserving to the States respectively, the Appointment of the Officers, and the Authority of training the Militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;<br>
						To exercise exclusive Legislation in all Cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten Miles square) as may, by Cession of particular States, and the Acceptance of Congress, become the Seat of the Government of the United States, and to exercise like Authority over all Places purchased by the Consent of the Legislature of the State in which the Same shall be, for the Erection of Forts, Magazines, Arsenals, dock-Yards, and other needful Buildings;—And<br>
						To make all Laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into Execution the foregoing Powers, and all other Powers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United States, or in any Department or Officer thereof.</div>
						<div class="sect">Importance</div>
						<div class="text">The powers of Congress are outlined in this section, allowing them many powers in foreign affairs and monetary usage by the government. They also gain many rights to regulate the business of the county's citizens with the good of America and its populous in mind. Despite the many powers listed, this section is, in many ways, a limitation of the powers of Congress to only what is written.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="sectnine">
						<div class="sect gap">Section Nine</div>
						<div class="text">The Migration or Importation of such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit, shall not be prohibited by the Congress prior to the Year one thousand eight hundred and eight, but a Tax or duty may be imposed on such Importation, not exceeding ten dollars for each Person.<br>
						The Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.<br>
						No Bill of Attainder or ex post facto Law shall be passed.<br>
						No Capitation, or other direct, Tax shall be laid, unless in Proportion to the Census or enumeration herein before directed to be taken.<br>
						No Tax or Duty shall be laid on Articles exported from any State.<br>
						No Preference shall be given by any Regulation of Commerce or Revenue to the Ports of one State over those of another: nor shall Vessels bound to, or from, one State, be obliged to enter, clear, or pay Duties in another.<br>
						No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law; and a regular Statement and Account of the Receipts and Expenditures of all public Money shall be published from time to time.<br>
						No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.</div>
						<div class="sect">Importance</div>
						<div class="text">The first line in this section dictates that Congress may not ban international slave trade until 1808. The next clauses describe that the rights to trial for every citizen may not be infringed upon unless necessary under there is ongoing fighting within the country's borders. Congress is also not allowed to tax with the benefit of specific states in mind. This section opens up interstate commerce and makes it illegal to tax commerce across state lines. Finally, the Constitution once again rejects the monarchy from which America fought against by outlawing titles of nobility and not allowing other countries to grant government officials such titles without approval from Congress.</div>
					</div>
					<div class="sectten">
						<div class="sect gap">Section Ten</div>
						<div class="text">No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.<br>
						No State shall, without the Consent of the Congress, lay any Imposts or Duties on Imports or Exports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing it's inspection Laws: and the net Produce of all Duties and Imposts, laid by any State on Imports or Exports, shall be for the Use of the Treasury of the United States; and all such Laws shall be subject to the Revision and Controul of the Congress.<br>
						No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.</div>
						<div class="sect">Importance</div>
						<div class="text">Unlike the previous two sections, this section specifically lists the powers that Congress has over the states, not regulation of the powers of Congress. This sets the federal government in charge of all treaties and foreign relations, money production, and law impairing the legitimacy of the courts and trials. States are also restricted from placing duties on foreign products without the consent of Congress. The section expands the legislative branch's power over the states and any actions they commit that could be detrimental to the nation's status as a whole.</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="two">
					<div class="arttitle">Article Two</div>
					<div class="sectone">
						<div class="sect gap">Section One</div>
						<div class="text">The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows<br>
						Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.<br>
						The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of them for President; and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the said House shall in like Manner chuse the President. But in chusing the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representation from each State having one Vote; A quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member or Members from two thirds of the States, and a Majority of all the States shall be necessary to a Choice. In every Case, after the Choice of the President, the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice President.<br>
						The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.<br>
						No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.<br>
						In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.<br>
						The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be encreased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.<br>
						Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:—"I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."</div>
						<div class="sect">Importance</div>
						<div class="text indent">The President is an official position outlined in the Constitution. The President is the executive position of the United States, and serves for four years. The President has a Vice President who serves alongside him or her.</div>
						<div class="text indent">Electors are an official position outlined in the Constitution, each state has them, and states choose how to appoint their electors. The electors appointed cannot already hold another official position in the government United States. The number of electors that a state gets is equal to the number of their Senators plus the number of their Representatives in the House of Representatives.
						</div>
						<div class="text indent">Appointed Electors meet in their own States and each cast votes for two people. At the very least one of these people chosen by an Elector must not live in the elector’s own state. A document is then created by the Electors clearly showing the votes casted for each person, and all of the electors sign and certify the document. The document is sealed, and sent to the President of the Senate, who is the current Vice President of the United States unless he or she is absent. If the Vice President is absent, the Senate votes for a new individual to be the President of the Senate. (President of the Senate: Vice President of the United States) This President of the Senate will - in front of the members of the House of Representatives and Senate - open all of the certified documents, and count the votes. If one person has the majority of votes after all the votes from each State are added together, then that person will be the next President of the United States. If in the unlikely case that two people have a majority, then the House of Representatives votes between the two of them, and whoever has the most votes becomes the next President of the United States. If in the extremely unlikely case that none of the people voted for by the Electors received a majority of the votes, then the House of Representatives votes between the top 5 people with the most votes, and whoever receives the most votes from the House of Representatives becomes the President of the United States. The Person with the second greatest amount of votes from the Electors will be the next Vice President. But, in the unlikely event that there are two or more people tied, then the Senate votes between them, and whoever has the most votes becomes the Vice President of the United States.</div>
						<div class="text indent">Congress has the power to determine when Electors are chosen in their State, and when they cast votes. Different days cannot be selected for different States. The President of the United States must have been born a citizen while in the borders of the United States, must be 35+ years old, and must have lived in the United States for the previous 14 years of their life.</div>
						<div class="text indent">Congress has the power to make laws determining what happens when the President of the United States, and Vice President of the United States dies, resigns, or is unable to serve. The laws that Congress makes should outline the Position that takes over until the President of Vice President is once again able to serve, or, until a new election takes place.</div>
						<div class="text indent">The President shall be compensated a certain amount at outlined times. The amount of compensation cannot be modified during his or her term, and the President cannot receive any extra compensation.</div>
						<div class="text indent">The President of the United States must state "I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States." before he or she serves.</div>
					</div>

						<div class="text">The President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militia of the several States, when called into the actual Service of the United States; he may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices, and he shall have Power to grant Reprieves and Pardons for Offences against the United States, except in Cases of Impeachment.<br>
						He shall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to make Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall appoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the supreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose Appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by Law: but the Congress may by Law vest the Appointment of such inferior Officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the Courts of Law, or in the Heads of Departments.<br>
						The President shall have Power to fill up all Vacancies that may happen during the Recess of the Senate, by granting Commissions which shall expire at the End of their next Session.</div>
						<div class="sect">Importance</div>
						<div class="text indent">The President acts as the Commander of the Army and Navy of the United States, and of the Militias within the United States if their service is required. The President may order that members of his cabinet give him their honest testimony on their work in writing. The President may also reduce sentencing for any criminal convicted of crimes against the United States, except when they have been impeached by Congress.</div>
						<div class="text indent">The President may enter treaties with foreign nations when two thirds or more of Senators agree. The President may select individuals to serve as Federal Government Officials can then approved by the Senate. Congress may, if it wishes, delegate or modify the manner in which Federal Government Officials are appointed.</div>

					<div class="sect">Importance</div>
					<div class="text">This article carries over all contracts and agreements in the United States before the signing of the Constitution. It marked a willingness to create a system in support of the people. It also establishes the federal government, born under the Constitution, as the supreme authority over the laws of all lesser governments within the United States.  The article requires all representatives and office holders to act under oath, but they cannot be bound to any religious requirements or establishments.</div>
