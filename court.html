				<div class="title">Oregon v. Mitchell (1970)</div>
				<div class="text">Soon after the passing of the Voting Rights Act Amendments through Congress, the banning of literacy tests in the amendment prompted several states to challenge its validity, claiming the federal government was overstepping and violating the rights of individual states. The case made its way up to the Supreme Court. The final ruling from the Supreme Court was a 5-4 decision in favor of the Amendment. This meant that Congress had the power to pass laws or amendments protecting or expanding voting rights, and therefore Congress technically has the power to override state disenfranchisement laws for ex-felons. Many states have disenfranchisement laws restricting the voting rights of ex-felons during a probationary period, others not allowing it at all without a petition to the government. If Congress were to pass laws expanding voting rights for ex-felons, they would be protected under this ruling.</div>

				<div class="title">Richardson v. Ramirez (1974)</div>
				<div class="text">Three ex-felons were denied the right to vote in California due to their past convictions, prompting them to form a petition naming four California officials for acting against the three men and violating their Constitutional rights. The case was brought to the California Supreme Court, where the court ruled in favor of the men who were not allowed to vote. The ruling said that the disenfranchisement of said ex-felons violated the 14th Amendment. However, the US Supreme Court decided differently, saying that a felony was within reason for disenfranchising the right to vote. When asked about his opinion on the ruling, former Civil Rights Defense Lawyer Christopher Murray claimed that "it undermines the intent of the criminal justice system, which is dedicated toward reforming convicts, and yet, even though they are supposedly reformed...they are not allowed to enjoy the freedoms that other citizens enjoy...It promotes recidivism" (Taylor).</div>

				<div class="title">Hunter v. Underwood (1985)</div>
				<div class="text">This case was finally decided by the Supreme Court, with the object of the case being a section of the Alabama State Constitution. The section involving disenfranchisement for specific crimes was under scrutiny for being highly discriminatory, seeing as the section was written in 1901. Its contents described that the right to vote could be restricted for anybody who, among many other discriminatory reasons, "crime involving moral turpitude." (Section 182). Along with this, the section states that disenfranchisement can be administered for things such as adultery, interracial relationships, and bigomy. The Supreme Court decided that specifically the phrase "moral turpitude" violated the 14th Amendment due to its racially motivated creation. In the words of John Knox, president of the Alabama Constitutional Congress of 1901, the document was meant to, within "the limits imposed by the Federal Constitution, to establish white supremacy in this State."</div>

				<div class="title">Montgomery v. Louisiana (2012)</div>
				<div class="text">The case of Montgomery v. Louisiana covers the Supreme Court ruling on the sentencing of juveniles to life sentences without parole. The argument came decades after Henry Montgomery was sentenced to life in prison as a juvenile for a murder charge. The sentence was without parole, which came under scrutiny in the 21st century after the ruling of Miller v. Alabama, which ruled against juvenile sentencing without parole. Montgomery's case came to the Supreme Court, where the court ruled that his sentencing was unconstitutional, repeating the Miller v. Alabama ruling and enforcing it more on a national scale. This ruling signified that juveniles cannot be considered equal in punishment to adult equivalents, meaning a sentence with no chance of release from prison for juveniles was cruel and unnecessary.</div>

				<div class="title">Griffin v. Pate (2016)</div>
				<div class="text">Disenfranchisement of felons in Iowa is permanent, meaning a felon cannot vote at any point in time even if they have fully served their sentences. This law was challenged all the way to the Iowa Supreme Court, where they ruled that the state is allowed to permanently revoke the right to vote over a felony. Although the objective of a sentence is to have the convict serve a punishment fit the crime, this ruling allows for punishment that expands beyond the sentence, which is debated to be an infringement of a person's 14th Amendment rights. This case is not necessarily completely decided, appeals to federal courts are still possible, meaning different rulings could come from the case.</div>
