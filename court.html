				<div class="title">Oregon v. Mitchell (1970)</div>
				<div class="text">Soon after the passing of the Voting Rights Act Amendments through Congress, the banning of literacy tests in the amendment prompted several states to challenge its validity, claiming the federal government was overstepping and violating the rights of individual states. The case made its way up to the Supreme Court. The final ruling from the Supreme Court was a 5-4 decision in favor of the Amendment. This meant that Congress had the power to pass laws or amendments protecting or expanding voting rights, and therefore Congress technically has the power to override state disenfrnachisement laws for ex-felons. Many states have disenfranchisemnent laws restricting the voting rights of ex-felons during a probationary period, other not allowing it at all without a petition to the government. If Congress were to pass laws expanding voting right for ex-felons, they would be protected under this ruling.</div>

				<div class="title">Richardson v. Ramirez (1974)</div>
				<div class="text">Three ex-felons were denied the right to vote in California due to their past convictions, prompting them to form a petition naming four California officials for acting against the three men and violating their Constitutional rights. The case was brought to the California Supreme Court, where the court ruled in favor of the men who were not allowed to vote. The ruling said that the disenfranchisement of said ex-felons violated the 14th Amendment. However, the US Supreme Court decided differently, saying that a felony was within reason for disenfranchising the right to vote.</div>

				<div class="title">Hunter v. Underwood (1985)</div>
				<div class="text">This case was finally decided by the Supreme Court, with the object of the case being a section of the Alabama State Constitution. The section involving disenfranchisement for specific crimes was under scrutiny for being highly discriminatory, seeing as the section was written in 1901. Its contents described that the right to vote could be restricted for anybody who, among many other discriminatory reasons, "crime involving moral turpitude." (Section 182). Along with this, the section states that disenfranchisement can be administered for things such as adultery, interracial relationships, and bigomy. The Supreme Court decided that specifically the phrase "moral turpitude" violated the 14th Amendment due to its racially motivated creation. In the words of John Knox, president of the Alabama Constitutional Congress of 1901, the document was meant to, within "the limits imposed by the Federal Constitution, to establish white supremacy in this State."</div>
