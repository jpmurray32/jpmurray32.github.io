			<div class="title">Voting Rights of Felons</div>
			<div class="text indent">Last November voters in Florida approved a ballot measure restoring voting rights to nearly all people with served felony convictions. Those convicted of murder or a felony sexual offense, however, are excluded. Florida’s Legislature has been considering additional restrictions. For example, some people with criminal histories could be forced to pay back fines and fees to the court system before regaining the ability to vote. Micah W. Kubic, who is the executive director of the Florida chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, has said “This is a great big slap in the face to the voters and a way to discourage people from participating in the process” (Mazzei).</div>
			<div class="text indent">As candidates prepare to campaign for the 2020 election, some have given their position on whether they believe convicted felons should be able to vote. Senator Bernie Sanders has stated that he thinks every citizen should be able to vote regardless of their convictions. His home state of Vermot already allows felons to vote from prison. Mayor Pete Buttigieg, Senator Cory Booker, and Senator Elizabeth Warren have all taken the position that felons should be able to vote once released from prison, but now while incarcerated. Meanwhile, President Trump has implied that there should be restrictions e.g. for domestic terrorists.</div>
