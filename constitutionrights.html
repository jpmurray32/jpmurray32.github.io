				<div class="title">General Rights</div>
				<div class="text indent">Regarding the Justice System, all felonies are tried under the criminal courts system, as civil courts are typically reserved for disputes between citizens or other entities seeking reparations for physical or other types of injuries. However, it is possible for someone to be tried under both civil and criminal courts due to the nature of the dispute (i.e. assault). Under the 5th amendment, no person is able to be tried or convicted for the same crime twice, serious federal charges must be tried under a grand jury, and all are protected from having to reveal information that might subject them to prosecution. The latter of the rights must be repeated to you upon your arrest due to the ruling of Miranda v Arizona, where the Supreme Court ruled that a conviction could be carried out only if the defendant was notified of their right to an attorney and against self-incrimination before police questioning. Under the 6th amendment, the jury appointed by the state must be fully impartial (and the defendant or prosecutor has the ability to object to a certain person being included), the defendant must be tried within a short period of time since they began to be held to avoid indefinite suspension, cannot be subject to secretive prosecution techniques, must be informed of the charges against them, witnesses must make their statements under oath, and all criminal defendants MUST have an attorney to defend them during the trial (as referenced in Miranda v Arizona). Under the 8th amendment, the bail for the defendant must be set at a fair and reasonable price and the punishment given to the defendant must not be cruel or unusual (which includes sentences that are greatly disproportionate to the crime committed). If you feel that any of these rights were violated, it is possible that you could challenge the ruling due to the mistrial.</div>
