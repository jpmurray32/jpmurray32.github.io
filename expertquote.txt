"Do you believe that the 14th amendment is being violated by the disenfranchisement of felons from voting?"
"Yes. I believe it undermines the intent of the criminal justice system, which is dedicated toward reforming convicts, and yet, when they are reintroduced into society, even though they are supposedly reformed, they are not allowed to enjoy the freedoms that other citizens enjoy... It promotes recidivism."
-Christopher Murray (Former Civil Rights Defense Lawyer)
